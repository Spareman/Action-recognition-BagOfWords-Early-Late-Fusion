# Action-recognition-BagOfWords-Early-Late-Fusion
Video classification using the UCF101 dataset for action recognition. We extract SIFT, MFCC and STIP features from the videos, we encode them using the Bag of Words framework and we implement early and late feature fusion using different combinations of the feature types available.
