# Action-recognition-BagOfWords-Early-Late-Fusion
Video classification using the UCF101 dataset for action recognition. We extract SIFT, MFCC and STIP features from the videos, we encode them using the Bag of Words framework and we implement early and late feature fusion using different combinations of the feature types available.

The code is part of my Bachelor's thesis submited at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technological University of Athens, with the title "Video Action Recognition using Bag of Words and feature fusion".
